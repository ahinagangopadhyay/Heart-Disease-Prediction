# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This is a very simple Machine learning project which  predicts whether the patient has 10-year risk of future coronary heart disease (CHD).
An existing dataset has been used based on residents of Massachusetts.
This prediction model primarily uses the algorithm of Logistic Regression and this project has been made mainly to understand the basic fundamentals of using logistic regression and to learn how to train and test data.
